created 2 users 
        2 groups
        
  create 2 file without   
            sudo touch file1 & file2
            
  give ownership to file to specific user
   
       sudo chown user1:user1 /home/maroof-56/file1 
       
  change user ownership for user but same grp
  
       sudo chown user1 file2 
       sudo chown user2 file1
       
  change user ownership for user but diff grp
       
       sudo chown user1:grp2 file1  (for file1 user is user1 & has grp2 )
       sudo chown user2:grp1 file2  (for file2 user is  user2 but grp1 )
       
 unfortunately  i created file1 inside /home/maroof-56 instead of user1 
 
       find file1 using find command - find /home/maroof-56 -name "file1"
       
       & then move file1 to user1  - mv /home/maroof-56/file1 /home/user1
       
       & switch as user1 & read file 
       
       
 if u wont make home directory when making user then u wont able to do anything inside user
 
 make home dir - mkdir /home/user 
 
      * MAKE USER WITH DIR 
        
         - USERADD -M USERNAME
         
         - USERADD -M -D  /CUDTOM/HOME/DIR USERNAME (-D HERE FOR CUSTOM HOME DIRECTORY OTHER THAN DEFAULT)
         
         
         
       * set user passwd 
       
         u cant set userpasswd from inside the user if below get,so u can set it from admin
         $ ls -l /etc/shadow
        -rw-r----- 1 root shadow 1511 Oct  8 21:39 /etc/shadow
        
        
        * ERROR : user1 is not in the sudoers file.
               - means user1 has not permission to use sudo
               
               
        * ADD USER2 IN GRP2 USING NANO
           
               -  sudo nano /etc/group ( Find the line that starts with grp1: and add user2 to the list of users in that group)
               -  It should look something like this 
                   grp1:x:1008:user1,user2
                   

       * Reading file1 from user2 & vie versa
       
         -CONDITION
         
           - 1. File1 has permission to read other
           - 2. user2 should be in user1 grp & grp has read permission to set
           
           - CAT /HOME/USER1/FILE1  ((To read File1)



     *  CHOWN  (Change Ownership of file )
       
            - U cant change userOwnership when u loggedIn as user1 ,to change that u required as root user 
            - SUDO CHOWN USER2 /HOME/USER1/FILE1  (Give  full path to change file1 ownership) 
            
            
     * CHANGE OWNERSHIP AND READ OTHER USERFILE (it required full path with every command)
     
            - Change ownership of file1 to user2 
               chown user2 /home/user1/file1
            
            - Verify it 
               ls -l /home/user1/file1
               
            - Read It 
               cat /home/user1/file1 
               
               
       * CHGRP  ( TO CHANGE GRP OWNERSHIP )
       
            - sudo chgrp grp2 /home/user1/file1  (Changed File1 grp to grp2 )
