         (ps.top.kill,nice command)
         
     ** ps (Process Status)
      
     - use to display all the running process in the linux system
      
      - ps -e | ps -A  ( to check the the running process)
      - ps -ef | more  ( for full format) more detail
      - ps aux | more  (more and more detail)
      
     - to see process by name 
      
      - ps -u root ( to see root user ) 
      - ps -u usename ( to see user process)
      - ps -u u | more 
      - ps -G u (to see grp process associated)
      - ps -ejH ( to see tree of process) like it show sub process
      
      
    ** top (table of process)
    
      - top shows real-time view of running process in linux nd and display kernel managed task 
      - it also provide sysytem info summary that shows resources utilization including cpu and memory usage 
      (from when the system is on,how much user ava,running and sleep process,task  etc 
      - u can easily track cpu memory uti ,can measure performance etc
      
      
      - there are numbers of command ava with top 
      
       top with c = shows path 
                k = to kill any process from inside 
                n = to change the number of task display
              d,s = to refresh ( by default it refresh after  sec)
                m = to sort linux process by memory usage
                r = to change nice value of process(-ve value have high priority -ve have less)
                u = to filter task by user
                f = field management (like u want more column or to delete column unused use this)
                use arrow key  to select field and type space to remove * marks from that field 
                user right arrow key to select field and sort the filed 
                to cahnge color press z ,b to bold
                
              
     ** Kill 
     
     - use to terminate process manually
     
     - kill options pid
      (options = signal name or no)
      (pid = process id)
      
      - kill -l to see detail 
      
      - Ex 
         - kill -1 pid (to restart th prcess)
         - kill -2 pid (interupt from keyboard like ctrl c)
         - kil  -9 pid ( forcefully terminate the process)
         - kill -15pid (kill process rqacefully)
         
         
    ** Nice 
     
         - Nice value lies fromm -20 to 19 
         lower the nice value higher the priority 
         - to check nice value simply type (ps -l pid) 
         - we can also change nice value according to importance
          Ex: type ( nice -n -10(value u want to give) /home/maroof/filename)
          
    ** Jobs 
    
       used to see the active jobs 
       - simply typed jobs to see available active jobs
       
       - there are 2 variant in that
         - bg ( resume jobs to background) means jobs will done in background
           helps to use terminal for other work
         - fg (resume jobs to foreground )
         - bg %jid (to resume specific job in bg)
         - fg %jid (  "" )
         
     ** nohup  (widely used ) 
     
       if u want your process keep running even after closing terminal ,use nohup
     
      - nohup process & ( command to use ) 
      it create nohup.out log file where it stored u data 
      - nohup process > /dev/null 2>&1 & 
        no output will store in nohup.out file
