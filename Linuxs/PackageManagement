      Package Management 
     
        In pacakge management linux system like centos red hat based uses YUM/DNF AND RPM 
        &
         YUM (tool & command ) 
        - ( yellow-dog updater modified ) 
        - primary package management tool for redhat
          
       Apt for debaian based , ubuntu , kali linux etc 
     **if u r root user u dont need to add sudo for installation else u have to add
       
      - upgrade (will delete the old package)
      - update  (keep the old pac , so we can rollback)
      
      - apt install package name
      - apt remove package name 
      - apt autoremove ( to remove the dependencies also ) 
      
      
      - There are two types of package tool available 
         
         - Low Level.
           - it handle task like installing/removing file 
           - like   Debian based - dpkg
           -        redhat based - rpm 
         
         - High Level.
           - It handle task like performing of metadata searching & dependency resolution.
           - Debian  - apt-get
           - Redhat  - yum 
           
        - when we remove some packagw with apt remove package_name it remove its package but the configuration file is left on system
        so to remove configuration file or completely remove package 
          apt purge package_name to completely remove pakage
          
         - to check  which required file will download to ur package simply type
            apt install -s  package_name
                    OR
            apt-get install -s package_name
            
         * To Upgrade your kernel 
           apt-get dist-upggrade
           
           
         * dpkg
           - after download any application with with .deb structure 
           - type dpkg -i package_name 
           - it will give dependency error coz it doesnot directy download from repository but
           - the required file that showed couldnot download will be stored sommewhere like in cache memory 
           - so type apt-get update it will install dependency automatically &  then
           - typed apt-get -f upgrade (-f stand with fix here)
           - again typed dpkg -i package_name to install the app
           - type which package_name to check where it install
           - to confirm installation type dpkg --get-selcctions | grep package_name
           - dpkg --remove package_name to remove  & dpkg --purge to completely remove
