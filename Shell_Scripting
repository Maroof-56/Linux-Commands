     FUNCTIONS 
     
     
     
     	A Block of code which perform some task & run when it is called..
     	Can be reuse many times in our program which lessen the lines of code.
     	we can pass arguments to method.
     	
     	
     	
     	
    BASENAME 
    
     It gives the file name when u enter the path
     
      basename /home/maroof/mysccripts/test.csv
     o/p - test.csv
     
     
   DIRNAME
   
     It gives the dir name of the file present in
     
         dirname /home/maroof/mysccripts/test.csv
          o/p -      /home/maroof/mysccripts
          
   REALPATH
     
     gives the actual path of file ,dir
     helps for  use in searching
     
      realpath test.csv
      o/p -      /home/maroof/mysccripts/test.csv
      
      
      
   RANDOM 
     
      it generate  random number between 0 to 32767
   
      - echo $RANDOM
      
      
   UID
   
      Gives the user id of user logged in
      
      - echo $UID
      - User UID is always  - 1000
      - Root UID is always  - 0
      
      
   1. $#    - Give the number of arguments passes to a script or function.
   
   2. $?    - Last command was executed successfully or not.
   
   3. ${0}  - Give you the file name
      
   4. ${1}  - This will hold/store the arguments that passes through script.
   
   5. $@    - Gives you the number of arguments passes through script
   
   6. ${@}  - It will store all the arguments passes thorugh script
   
   
   LS > File_name    ( single > means override the new things ) 
   
    it wil copy all the file of that loc into specified filename
    
    1.- maroof-56@maroof-56-VirtualBox:~/myscripts$ ls > all_file.txt
    
maroof-56@maroof-56-VirtualBox:~/myscripts$ cat all_file.txt 
01_basic.sh

    2. date > allfile.txt
    
     maroof-56@maroof-56-VirtualBox:~/myscripts$ date > all_file.txt
      
maroof-56@maroof-56-VirtualBox:~/myscripts$ cat all_file.txt 
Thu Nov  7 04:01:59 PM IST 2024

      
    ***- See it will remove the previous things & add that new command reult.
    
    
   LS >> file_name   ( >>  to append ,means also wants previous one )
   
     pwd >> alfiles.txt
     
     
    *** - both result is available 
       maroof-56@maroof-56-VirtualBox:~/myscripts$ pwd >> all_file.txt 
       
maroof-56@maroof-56-VirtualBox:~/myscripts$ cat all_file.txt

/home/maroof-56/myscripts



     &> /dev/null 
    
    
      if u dont want print the output of a command on terminal or write in file , u can redirect output to /dev/null
      
      means output will vanish 
      
      
      
      ex;
      
      maroof-56@maroof-56-VirtualBox:~/myscripts$ cd /root/
bash: cd: /root/: Permission denied

maroof-56@maroof-56-VirtualBox:~/myscripts$ cd /root/ &> /dev/null

     *** see nothing prints after that
     
     - U can use this in any file 
     
     
     
     
     IF U WANT TO SEE DEBUGGING PROCESS OF SCRIPT
     
       - set -x 
       
       Put it at top of script to view each process line by line 
       
       
     If you want to exit script when a commands fails 
     
       - set -e
       
       
       
     BACKGROUND PROCESS 
     
     
        - nohup 
        
        if u have an script  to test & it will take too much time , in such case ur not able to use terminal until the script finish 
        
        so to background the process use nohup to easily use terminal for other use.
        
        syntax
        
        - nohup ./file_name & 
        
        
        
        Example :
         maroof-56@maroof-56-VirtualBox:~/myscripts$ nohup bash ./15_forloop_with_file.sh &

        
         maroof-56@maroof-56-VirtualBox:~/myscripts$ nohup: ignoring input and appending output to 'nohup.out'

         The process is running in the backgrround & output is stored in nohup.out file
         
         
         
         AUTOMATE  THE TASK 
         
          ONE TIME 
        - to execute script only one time use at
         
         ex : at 23:03 PM  (press enter)
         file_name 
         ( it will schedule your task at that time )
         
        - to check scheddule  task 
        
         atq (type )
         
        - to remove the schedule 
        
         atrm id
         
         
           REPETITIVE TAK
            CRONTAB 
           
            - crontab -l   ( to see existing )
            - crontab -e   ( to create )
